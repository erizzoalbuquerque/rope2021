# There's no Rope 2021
Remake of an old prototype. There's rope this time!...

...But there's no game (for now). We've been experimenting with different art styles and we built an art demo you can play on your browser or PC [**on the game's itch.io page**](https://eduardo-rizzo.itch.io/rope-2021).

You can also play an old "artless" level editor demo here:

[**Download it for Windows**](https://erizzoalbuquerque.github.io/rope2021/Docs/OnlineBuilds/WindowsBuild.zip)

[**Play it on browser**](https://erizzoalbuquerque.github.io/rope2021/Docs/Game/index.html) (You can't save between sessions on the browser)

Finally, you can play a VERY old full level prototype (no art at all, just squares) on [**it's old page**](https://gamejolt.com/games/there-s-no-rope-idea-prototype/178437)

Next Step: Remake the actual level with this new art Style. See ya in a few months!

Disclaimer: The majority of the code was wirtten in 2016 and is disgusting. Be kind. It will be refactored when needed.
